DateTimePicker
==============

A lightweight date and time picker
--------------

This is a work in progress

v0.1 was released on 2014-02-21. It is released under GPLv3. Please see the LICENSE file for more information. It possesses minimal funtionality for a datepicker.

While there are many issues, 

1. the most well known is that if the user clicks a datepicker activated input near the edge of the browser viewport, the calendar overflows off of the screen. This will be addressed in the v0.2 release.
2. Error catching and handling is also lacking.
